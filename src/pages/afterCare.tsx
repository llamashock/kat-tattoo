            <li className={`${styles.p}`}>DO NOT pick at or scratch tattoo during the healing process. This can pull out the ink. It is normal for tattoos to scab/ peel during healing as this is the bodyâ€™s natural healing process.</li>

            <li className={`${styles.p}`}>DO NOT expose your healing tattoo to the sun, tanning beds, hot tubs, swimming pools, lakes or any unclean conditions that may interfere with the healing process.</li>
